## Numerical methods for differential equations
This repo contains documentation and code for the lectures and coding projects in the course numerical methods for differential equations at LTH

* Project 1: Introduction to solving numerical ODEs using timestepping methods. Specifically using an explicit __Runge-Kutta method__ and __Lotka Voltera__ for nonstiff problems. 
* Project 2: Created a solver for 2 point boundary valued problems and for Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problems and the Schr√∂dinger equation.
* Project 3: Working with parabolic and hyperbolic differential equations using techniques from boundary value problems and initial value problems. Specifically the diffusion equation, the advection equation, the convection-diffusion equation and the Viscous Burgers equation.
